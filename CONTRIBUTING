Google Individual Contributor License

In all cases, contributors must sign a contributor license agreement,
either for an individual or corporation, before a patch can be
accepted. Please fill out the agreement for an individual or a
corporation, as appropriate.

If you or your organization is not listed there already, you should
add an entry to the AUTHORS file as part of your patch.

If you plan to add a significant component or large chunk of code, it
is recommended to bring it up on the discussion list for a design
discussion before writing code.

If appropriate, write a unit test that demonstrates your patch. Tests are the
best way to ensure that future contributors do not break your code
accidentally.
